# Machines

## Recipe Speed

Recipes are listed as consuming input materials and some amount of energy. Recipes can be completed as fast as there is input energy.

## Arrays

An array is a multiblock allowing for more lag-efficient processing. An array acts like multiple single machines and takes up the same volume as those single machines. Arrays are cheaper to upgrade; while the individual upgrade modules are cheaper, the array upgrade module applies to all machines in the array.
